## Smart Water Leakage Detection and Reduction
This project focuses on developing smart techniques to detect and reduce water leakage in large-scale water distribution networks. The aim is to enhance sustainability and infrastructure integrity by minimizing water loss through advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches.

# Key Features:
Leakage Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, to accurately detect leaks in real-time within water distribution systems. The models are trained on historical data and are capable of identifying potential leak points by analyzing patterns and anomalies in water flow and pressure.

Real-Time Monitoring: The system integrates with sensors and IoT devices to continuously monitor water flow, pressure, and consumption. Alerts are triggered when abnormal activities are detected, enabling prompt intervention to minimize water loss.

Predictive Maintenance: Implements predictive analytics to forecast potential leaks before they occur. By analyzing trends in data, the system can suggest proactive maintenance, reducing the likelihood of large-scale water loss events.

Visualization and Analytics: Provides detailed visualizations of water distribution networks, leakage points, and overall system health. This helps in better understanding the network's behavior and making informed decisions regarding maintenance and repairs.

Sustainability Focus: By reducing water leakage, this project contributes to environmental sustainability, ensuring efficient use of water resources and supporting conservation efforts.
